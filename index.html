        <p>Network refers to a system of interconnected entities, whether they are computers, devices, or people, that work together to share resources, information, or services. In the realm of information technology, a network can be a collection of computers linked together through various communication channels, enabling data exchange and connectivity across different geographical locations. Networks can be categorized into different types, such as Local Area Networks (LANs), which connect devices within a small area like a home or office, and Wide Area Networks (WANs), which span larger distances and can connect multiple LANs. Networking technologies and protocols ensure that data is transmitted securely and efficiently, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration. Beyond computing, the concept of a network also applies to social and organizational structures where individuals or entities are connected by relationships or interactions, emphasizing the importance of collaboration and resource sharing.</p>
